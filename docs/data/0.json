Otherwise, it returns a general state of 1 for other queries.\n2. The `quantify_feedback` function converts critic feedback into numerical rewards. It identifies positive keywords such as 'good', 'great', or 'excellent' in the feedback and assigns a score of 1 (positive feedback). If no such keywords are found, it returns -1 (negative or neutral feedback).\n3. The `determine_next_state` function calculates the next state based on the current state and user input.
